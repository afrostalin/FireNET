    \class QxtSshProcess
    \inmodule QxtNetwork
    \brief The QxtSshProcess class allows communication with a process invoked on an SSH server

    QxtSshProcess is an I/O device analogous to QProcess. It can invoke a command or SSH subsystem on
    the SSH server; the stdin, stdout, and stderr channels of the process are redirected through the
    channel.

    QxtSshProcess objects are created using the QxtSshClient::openProcessChannel() method.

/*!
 * \enum QxtSshProcess::TerminalType 
 * \value VanillaTerminal   A terminal with no special features
 * \value Vt102Terminal     A terminal that understands VT102 command codes
 * \value AnsiTerminal      A terminal that understands ANSI command codes
 */

/*! 
 * \fn QxtSshProcess::finished ( int exitCode )
 *
 * This signal is emitted when the process on the SSH server finishes. The parameter is the exit code of
 * the process. After the process has finished, the read buffer QxtSshProcess will still contain any
 * data the process may have written before terminating.
 *
 * Another process or subsystem may be invoked on the same channel after the first process terminates.
